While\r\nMadison can be used to collaborate on many different kinds of documents, the\r\nofficial version is being built with legislative and policy documents in mind.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about Madison, please open an issue and we will try to\r\nrespond as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nCheck out the [Madison Documentation](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/tree/master/docs)\r\nor jump right into the [Issue Log](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison/issues)\r\nfor more information on the project.\r\n\r\nWe have created a new, public mailing list for Madison development in Google\r\nGroups that you might be interested in subscribing to. We'll be using this as\r\nthe official channel for all Madison developer news, announcements, and chat\r\nfrom now on. (Though bugs should still be reported here on Github.) You can sign\r\nup for it here:\r\n\r\n[Madison Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/madison-developers)\r\n\r\nWe have also created a very short survey to find out more about the developers\r\nusing Madison. Please take a few minutes to fill out this survey so we can\r\nbetter understand what your needs are and who is using Madison:\r\n\r\n[Madison Developers Survey](http://goo.gl/forms/BV4Flc0zx7)\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n\r\nAs of 3.0, Madison has been broken into two separate pieces: a standalone\r\nAPI in Laravel (PHP) (the `server` folder) and a piece for the interface / client\r\nside of the system (Angular / JavaScript) (the `client` folder).\r\n\r\nSome modules are shared across repositories, such as our\r\n[internationalization locale files](https://github.com/opengovfoundation/madison-locales).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the `docs/INSTALL.md` or `docs/INSTALL.OSX.md` files for\r\nhow to install Madison.\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\n\r\nThere are a few different mechanisms for customizing Madison to your liking.\r\n\r\n### Language & i18n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the language in the system is defined in the `client/app/locales/`\r\nfolder within relevant JSON files, defined for each supported language. If you\r\ncreate a file that matches the necessary language name in\r\n`client/app/locales/custom/` this will overwrite what is set as default in the base\r\nlanguage files.\r\n\r\n### Style\r\n\r\nAny stylesheets placed within the `client/app/sass/custom/` folder will be processed\r\nduring the build and can overwrite any existing styles. You can also change sass\r\nvariables here. Reference the sass config files in `client/app/sass/config/` to see\r\nwhat variables can be changed.\r\n\r\n## Testing Suite\r\n\r\nTo run the full test suite for both client and server, run the `make test`\r\ncommand. Some setup is necesary, see below.\r\n\r\n### Server Testing\r\n\r\nTo run the tests, you will need to make sure to have a database created called\r\n`madison_testing`. Then you will need to run all migrations on that database\r\nwith the command `php artisan migrate --database=mysql_testing`.\r\n\r\nTo run only server tests, the command is `make test-server`.\r\n\r\n### Client Testing\r\n\r\nFor client testing to work properly, you need to have a vhost set up to be\r\nserving the client at `localhost:8888` with the API (server folder)\r\nmounted at `/api`. This vhost should also set two ENV vars:\r\n\r\n* `TESTING=true`\r\n* `DB_CONNECTION=mysql_testing`\r\n\r\nFor an example of what this config should look like for Apache, look at\r\n`travis/apache.conf`. This is the configuration file that is used\r\nfor running client tests on travis. Don't forget to add the domain to\r\n`/etc/hosts` as well!\r\n\r\nMake sure you have run `make deps` to have all dependencies installed. Once that\r\nis done you should be able to run `make selenium-start` to install and start\r\nyour local Selenium server.\r\n\r\nTo run the client tests only, the command is `make test-client`.\r\n\r\n## How to help\r\n\r\n* Open an issue, claim an issue, comment on an issue, or submit a pull request to resolve one\r\n* Document Madison - wiki documentation, installation guide, or docblocks internally\r\n* Clean up existing code - I'm sure we've taken shortcuts or added lazy code somewhere.\r\n",
